There is a(n) 100% chance that the host is running Linux 4.4.

Summary:  Ports 80, 443, 8080, and 8443 are open, suggesting web servers (HTTP, HTTPS) and potentially other applications.  Linux 4.4 is detected.

Possible Vulnerabilities:  Outdated OS (Linux 4.4) increases risk of known exploits targeting older kernels.  Unpatched web servers on ports 80, 443, 8080, 8443 are highly vulnerable.

Possible Attacks:  Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities (via OS-specific exploits), web server exploits (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), brute force attacks.

Exploitation Likelihood: High, due to open ports and outdated OS.

Remediation: Update Linux kernel immediately.  Apply all security patches to web servers.  Implement strong passwords and enable web application firewalls (WAFs).
